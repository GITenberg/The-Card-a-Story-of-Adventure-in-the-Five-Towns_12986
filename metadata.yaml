description: "The Card is a short comic novel written by Arnold Bennett in 1911 (titled\
  \ Denry the Audacious in the American edition). It was later made into a 1952 movie\
  \ starring Alec Guinness and Petula Clark.\nLike much of Bennett's best work, it\
  \ is set in the Potteries District of Staffordshire. It chronicles the rise of Edward\
  \ Henry (\"Denry\") Machin from washerwoman's son to Mayor of Bursley (a fictitious\
  \ town based on Burslem). This is accomplished through luck, initiative and a fair\
  \ bit of chutzpah (in slang a card is a 'character', an 'original'; a clever, audacious,\
  \ person).\nDenry Machin returned, as the slightly more mature \"Edward Henry\"\
  , in Bennett's sequel The Regent (1913) (titled The Old Adam in its first U.S. edition).\n\
